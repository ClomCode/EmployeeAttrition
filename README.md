# EmployeeAttrition
Created an R script that uses machine learning techniques to predict whether an employee is likely to leave a company.

Follow these steps to setup the R script named - "Main.R".

1.	Change line 11 to the appropriate directory where "Functions.R" and "EmployeeData.csv" can be found. 
2.	Change line 131 to the directory where you want the output file named - "PerformanceMetrics.txt" to be written to.
3.	Ensure RStudio is running on version 4.1.3 to get intended functionality, as this code was built on this version of R.
4.	Ensure all appropriate packages are available for download and install using an internet connection.
5.	The file should now run smoothly.
